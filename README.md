# What is it?
Piqd is an advanced social dating system for millenials that utilizes 
an advanced survey system and algorithmically precise humor.

# Dev setup

In order to develop for piqd, you'll want a package manager. Get 
[homebrew](brew.sh). Once you've done that, install Python 3

    brew install python3

Once you have python, use pip to install Django

    pip3 install django

You can find the docs/tutorials for Django [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/)

You will also want to install git-flow to manage branching and versioning, so 
use brew 

    brew install git-flow

[Here](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/GitFlowForGitHub.html) is a primer on how to use `git-flow` with Github
